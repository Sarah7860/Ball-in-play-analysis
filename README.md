**How long is the ball in play in the Women's Euros?**

Reading The Guardian’s article (https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/15/longer-games-less-football-ball-play-premier-league) about how long the ball is actually in play in the Premier League made me curious about how this compares in women’s football. Because the only data available to me right now is the StatsBomb open events data, I decided to check for myself how much action we got in the Women’s Euros 2022 and 2025. 

My hypothesis? the ball would be in play for longer in women’s football. This is just based on my hunch that perhaps in women’s football, match delaying tactics are not as prevalent. But that is just an uninformed guess. 

The data: I used two proxies for ball in play and total match duration due to a lack of better data. For ball in play, I summed the events duration data from StatsBomb which is basically the duration in seconds of any on ball event happening in the game. For total duration of the game, I used the maximum value of the minutes column in the StatsBomb data which is basically the last recorded minute of a game when any on ball event took place. Yes, these indicators wouldn’t give me perfect answers but they would give me a sensible idea of where things stand. 

What did I find?

♦️ Premier League had longer games on average than the Women’s Euros - In the Premier League, matches are lasting for 100 minutes and 36 seconds on average while in the Women’s Euros the total match durations were 94 (2022) and 95 (2025). Even if we factor in a couple of more minutes to account for our imperfect indicators (that would understate the total duration), the matches were shorter in the group stages of the Women’s Euros. 

♦️ There isn’t a massive difference in ball in play between the Premier League and the Women’s Euros - On average, ball in play in the Premier League in the last 10 seasons has ranged between 54 and 58 minutes. For the Women’s Euros group stages, the average minutes when the ball was in play was 51 minutes. When you compare percentages, the Premier League has the ball in play on average for roughly 55% of the game while in the Euros, the percentages are roughly 53%. 

♦️ When you look at individual teams, Spanish Women had the highest % of ball in play while Portugal women’s team had the lowest % of ball in play in the Euros 2025.

What do I make of all this?

Honestly, the data isn’t perfect for me to make any bold claims. What I have learned though, is to always check my assumptions with data.
